Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the surrounding land or sea level, and are generally steeper than hills. They are typically characterized by a pointed top, or peak. 
Here are some facts about mountains:
Classification
Geologists generally classify mountains as landforms that rise at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) above the surrounding area. 
Formation
Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism, which can raise the surface of the earth. 
Types
There are four main types of mountains: upwarped, volcanic, fault-block, and folded. 
Climate
Mountains have different climates than the land at sea level and nearby flat land. 
Examples
Some examples of mountains include:
The Andes: The longest continental mountain range in the world, stretching for around 7,000 km (ca. 4,350 miles) across seven South American countries. 
The Rocky Mountains: A mountain range with at least 100 separate ranges, including the Canadian Rockies, the Middle Rockies, the Southern Rockies, and the Colorado Plateau. 
The Transantarctic Mountains: A mountain range that divides East Antarctica from West Antarctica.
